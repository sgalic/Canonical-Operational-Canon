# Operational Canon

## 1. Preamble

This document establishes the Operational Canon, a structured and evolving framework of statements, assumptions, definitions, and principles that are considered valid within a specific project or conceptual domain. Its role is to provide a coherent, logically consistent foundation for reasoning, development, modelling, and simulation, whether undertaken by humans or AI systems. The canon functions not as passive documentation, but as an active and authoritative body of internal logic to which all reasoning must conform unless explicitly and transparently suspended.

All statements contained within the canon are to be treated as operational truths by default. These statements form the core of structured thought within the domain. Their validity is presumed unless a departure is formally declared. The canon is authoritative but not absolute. It may be revised, expanded, or corrected, provided that such changes are intentional and justified. Temporary suspensions of its content—when considering alternative assumptions or hypotheses—must be expressly declared.

This preamble is the only component that must be inherited from the Canon of Canons (CoC) into any derived canon. All additional content is domain-specific. In cases of contradiction, the preamble of the Canon of Canons holds interpretative precedence unless a clear and reasoned departure is stated.

## 2. Purpose, Scope, and Format

The purpose of the Operational Canon is to make reasoning explicit, stable, and traceable. It enables consistent interpretation within a defined domain and supports disciplined development of ideas, models, and systems. The canon is not intended to impose unnecessary rigidity, but to sustain clarity and coherence so that both human and artificial reasoning remain aligned. Its function is to support understanding, not restrict it.

The authority of the canon applies only within its declared domain. Beyond that domain, it does not assert validity. Each derived canon must begin with the preamble from the Canon of Canons; this is the only universally required element. All other sections—definitions, assumptions, principles, or domain-specific material—may be included as needed but are not mandatory. Structure should be employed only where it enhances clarity. The canon must remain readable as a continuous text.

To ensure accessibility and longevity, the canon should be maintained in a format suitable for both human readers and AI systems. Markdown is preferred as the authoritative format because it preserves structure without unnecessary complexity, is compatible with version control systems, and remains platform-independent. Other formats such as PDF, LaTeX, or word-processed documents may be produced for publication or distribution, but they do not replace the Markdown source. The canon should evolve alongside the project it serves, updating when necessary while preserving internal coherence and traceability.

## 3. Authority and Hierarchy of Canon

Within its domain, the Operational Canon is the primary reference for interpretation and reasoning. Its statements are to be treated as correct and applicable unless a formal departure or revision is declared. When uncertainty or conflict arises, interpretation follows a defined hierarchy. First in authority is the preamble of the Canon of Canons. Next is the preamble of the specific canon derived from it. All remaining statements in that canon follow thereafter. External sources—such as scientific literature, regulations, or empirical data—may inform interpretation but cannot override canon statements unless a departure is explicitly declared.

Readers and AI systems must treat canon statements as binding within the defined domain. If a statement conflicts with evidence, logic, or newly accepted knowledge, the correct response is not to ignore or silently override it, but to declare a departure or propose revision. This preserves transparency, avoids inconsistency, and maintains the integrity of the canon as a shared reference.

## 4. Revision and Deviation Protocol

Although the canon is authoritative, it is not static. Revision is both possible and expected as understanding improves or circumstances change. Any modification must be deliberate, justified, and recorded. Silent changes—especially to the preamble—are improper. Version control tools such as Git are recommended to track revisions, preserve history, and make changes auditable.

A temporary suspension of one or more canon statements is defined as a **departure**. Departures allow exploration of alternative assumptions, hypotheses, or models without permanently altering the canon. A departure must be explicitly declared, justified, and reversible. It does not modify the canon unless later adopted into the canonical text through formal revision.

Through this balance of authority and adaptability, the Operational Canon provides a stable foundation for structured reasoning while remaining open to improvement. It ensures that knowledge remains coherent, interpretable, and maintainable over time.
