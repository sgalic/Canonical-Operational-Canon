# README – Operational Canon of Canons (v1.1)

## Overview
The *Operational Canon of Canons* (CoC) defines a structured, evolving framework for reasoning, knowledge management, and decision logic. It establishes how individual “canons” — domain-specific bodies of rules, assumptions, and principles — should be written, maintained, and interpreted.

## Purpose
The CoC provides a coherent foundation that ensures consistency between human and AI reasoning across domains. It specifies how authority is assigned, how revisions are documented, and how departures from canonical rules are declared. Its goal is clarity, not rigidity: the canon serves understanding rather than constraint.

## Structure
Each derived canon must include the CoC Preamble. Other sections — definitions, principles, domain rules — are optional and organized according to project needs. The CoC defines the hierarchy of authority, revision protocol, and deviation procedures that govern all subordinate canons.

## Format and Persistence
Markdown (.md) is the authoritative storage format for all canons. It ensures cross-platform readability, AI interpretability, and reliable version control. Other renderings (PDF, LaTeX, HTML) are for presentation only. Repositories should use Git or equivalent tools to preserve version history, authorship, and cryptographic integrity of each commit.

## Governance and Evolution
While authoritative, the CoC is intentionally adaptable. Revisions are accepted only with documented justification and changelog entries. Temporary suspensions — *Departures from Canon* — may be declared for experimental or hypothetical purposes but must be reversible unless formally adopted.
